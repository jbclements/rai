Entry: Move to git / github / racket package
Date: Sun Jun  2 19:13:02 EDT 2013

Starting on a fresh repo.

Maybe good to make a list of the small things that need to be done.

- FIXES:

  - ai-stream.rkt   (write in terms of ai-array.rkt output?)

  - delay line allocation: phase 1 -> phase 2.

  - make time block explicit (subsampling) and fixed size

  - proper feedback operator

  - compute transfer function as ratfunc.


- FEATURES:

  - constant arrays.

  - presets

  - state initialization

  - generate GUI from description

  - loop fusion?




Entry: Add a `where' form?
Date: Sun Jun  2 19:27:46 EDT 2013

This would allow specification of inputs/outputs in a more
straightforward way, such that output arity is visible at the syntax
level.

E.g.

(proc (in ...)
      (out ...)
  (where
     ((a ...)
      (b ...)
      ...)))



Entry: Run generated C code from Scheme
Date: Mon Jun  3 19:48:43 EDT 2013

3 ways to run code in Scheme:

- provide separate interpretation, like ai-stream.rkt (reference implementation)
- compile the pre-C imperative intermediate language to Scheme
- load a compiled C module

Low on time and energy.  What needs to happen next?


- LLVM C/C++ bindings

- Load C code in Scheme

- Scheme semantics based on ai-array form output
