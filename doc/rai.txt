Maybe good to make a list of the small things that need to be done.

- FIXES:

  - ai-stream.rkt   (write in terms of ai-array.rkt output?)

  - delay line allocation: phase 1 -> phase 2.

  - make time block explicit (subsampling) and fixed size

  - proper feedback operator

  - compute transfer function as ratfunc.


- FEATURES:

  - constant arrays.

  - presets

  - state initialization

  - generate GUI from description

  - loop fusion?
